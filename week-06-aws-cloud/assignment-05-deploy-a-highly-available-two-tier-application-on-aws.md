# Assignment 5 — Deploy a Highly Available Two-Tier Application on AWS (VPC + ALB + ASG + Multi-AZ RDS)

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will design and deploy a highly available two-tier web application on AWS: highly available networking across two Availability Zones, an Application Load Balancer, an Auto Scaling Group for the web tier, and a private Multi-AZ RDS database. You must prove high availability with real failure tests.

# Task 1 — Create HA Networking (VPC + 4 Subnets + IGW + NAT + Route Tables)

## Goal

Build a VPC (10.0.0.0/16) with two public and two private subnets across two Availability Zones, an Internet Gateway, a NAT Gateway, and the matching public/private route tables.

### Evidence

---

#### Screenshot 5 — NAT Gateway status showing Available and the Elastic IP

# Task 2 — Create Security Groups (ALB, EC2, RDS) with Least Privilege

## Goal

Create `ha-alb-sg` (HTTP public), `ha-web-sg` (HTTP only from `ha-alb-sg`, SSH from your IP), and `ha-db-sg` (database port only from `ha-web-sg`).

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — ALB Security Group inbound rules

#### Screenshot 7 — EC2 Security Group inbound rules showing the ALB Security Group reference and SSH from your IP


![alt text](image-44.png)
---

#### Screenshot 8 — RDS Security Group inbound rule showing the database port allowed only from the EC2 Security Group


![alt text](image-45.png)
---

# Task 3 — Deploy Database Tier (RDS Multi-AZ in Private Subnets)

## Goal

Launch a private, Multi-AZ RDS database (MySQL or PostgreSQL) using the private DB Subnet Group and `ha-db-sg`.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 9 — RDS summary showing Multi-AZ = Yes and Publicly accessible = No


![alt text](image-46.png)
---

#### Screenshot 10 — RDS connectivity section showing the DB Subnet Group and Security Group


![alt text](image-47.png)
---

# Task 4 — Build a Launch Template (User Data Installs App + Connects to DB)

## Goal

Create a Launch Template whose user data installs the web-server runtime, deploys the application, configures the database connection, and starts the required services.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 11 — Launch Template details showing that user data exists, including a visible snippet


![alt text](image-48.png)
---

#### Screenshot 12 — A running instance created from the template showing that the application responds on port 80 through a local test or browser using its public IP


![alt text](image-49.png)
---

# Task 5 — Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB) Across 2 Public Subnets

## Goal

Create an internet-facing ALB across both public subnets with an HTTP listener and a healthy instance target group.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 13 — ALB details showing two public subnets in two Availability Zones


![alt text](image-50.png)
---

#### Screenshot 14 — Target group showing at least one healthy target


![alt text](image-56.png)
---

# Task 6 — Create Auto Scaling Group (ASG) in 2 Public Subnets

## Goal

Create an Auto Scaling Group from the Launch Template across both public subnets, with desired capacity 2, minimum 2, and maximum 4, registered to the ALB target group.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 15 — Auto Scaling Group showing desired, minimum, and maximum capacity and the selected subnet Availability Zones


![alt text](image-51.png)
---

#### Screenshot 16 — EC2 instances list showing two running instances in different Availability Zones


![alt text](image-52.png)
---

# Task 7 — Configure App to Use RDS + Validate Read/Write

## Goal

Confirm the application communicates with the RDS database through the ALB DNS name with at least one read and one write operation.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 17 — Browser showing the application loaded through the ALB DNS name with the URL visible


![alt text](image-53.png)
---

#### Screenshot 18 — Proof of a database write through a UI message or database query output


![alt text](image-54.png)
---

# Task 8 — High Availability Tests (Must Do Both)

## Goal

Test A: terminate one web instance and confirm the Auto Scaling Group replaces it automatically without interrupting the ALB.

Test B: simulate an Availability Zone impact (stop, detach, or reduce desired capacity in one AZ) and confirm the application stays available.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 19 — EC2 showing the terminated instance and the newly launched instance; timestamps are helpful


![alt text](image-55.png)
---

#### Screenshot 20 — Target group showing healthy targets after replacement


![alt text](image-60.png)
---

#### Screenshot 21 — Evidence that an instance was removed, detached, placed in Standby, or stopped in one Availability Zone


![alt text](image-57.png)
---

#### Screenshot 22 — Browser showing that the ALB DNS endpoint still works during the change


![alt text](image-59.png)

# Task 9 — Architecture and Test-Results Summary

## Goal

Summarize the VPC/subnet layout, the ALB and Auto Scaling Group setup, the private Multi-AZ RDS setup, and the results of both high-availability tests.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 23 — A simple architecture diagram, which may be hand-drawn, or an AWS console overview showing the components


![alt text](image-62.png)

### Notes

Summarize the VPC and subnets across the two Availability Zones.

Write your answer here.

Created a 10.0.0.0/16 VPC across two Availability Zones with four /24 subnets: two public subnets (10.0.1.0/24 and 10.0.2.0/24) for the web tier and two private subnets (10.0.11.0/24 and 10.0.12.0/24) for the database tier. An Internet Gateway provided public connectivity, while a NAT Gateway provided outbound internet access for the private subnets.


Summarize the ALB and Auto Scaling Group setup.

Write your answer here.

Configured an internet-facing Application Load Balancer across both public subnets and connected it to a Target Group for the web servers. The Auto Scaling Group uses a Launch Template, maintains a desired/minimum capacity of 2 instances with a maximum of 4, distributes instances across both Availability Zones, and uses ALB health checks to replace unhealthy instances automatically.

Summarize the private Multi-AZ RDS setup.

Write your answer here.


Created a DB subnet group containing both private subnets and deployed a MySQL RDS instance using Multi-AZ for high availability. The database is not publicly accessible and is protected by ha-db-sg, which allows database traffic only from the web-tier security group on port 3306.

Summarize the results of both high-availability tests.

Write your answer here.

The HA tests demonstrated that the application could continue operating when a web-tier instance became unavailable, with the Auto Scaling Group replacing unhealthy instances and the ALB routing traffic to healthy targets. The second test confirmed database/application availability through the ALB, with WordPress successfully performing read/write operations against the private RDS database.
